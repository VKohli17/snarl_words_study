- when the word "bhakts" is being used as a snarl, it is often accompanied by a "andh" (the hindi word for "blind"). Eg: `@SwamyBhakt: CAUTION\n\nBlind belief of Andh-Bhakts in FEKU will bring PRALAY for Hindus!!',,,,S`
- It is also an occurance that a tweet containing the word "bhakts" (when used in a snarl manner) has the words "Modi", "Rahul", "Hindus", and "Hindutva" in them. Eg: `Everyone is not like you Modi bhakts, we love Hassan Ali cause he is a champion! Aap log fasaadi ho, khud Indian Mu`
- In terms of non-snarl usage: the tweet generally has a mention of a particular diety or has paternalistic words associated with dieties like "Maa". Eg: `Maa always bless her bhakts \nwith prosperity and wealth!!\n\nShree Mahalaxmi Mandir`
